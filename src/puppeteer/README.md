For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

For NPX installation (opens a browser window):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "puppeteer": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation (uses headless chromium):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "puppeteer": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "--init",
          "-e",
          "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
          "mcp/puppeteer"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the Puppeter server:

### Docker

**NOTE** The docker implementation will use headless chromium, where as the NPX version will open a browser window.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "-e", "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true", "mcp/puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```
