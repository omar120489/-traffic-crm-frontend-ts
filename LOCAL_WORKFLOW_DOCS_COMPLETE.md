# Local Workflow Documentation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** All documentation for local-only workflow has been created and integrated

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Created `docs/LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md` (6.9KB)

A comprehensive guide for local-only development that includes:

- **Current Status**: Why we're using local-only workflow (large files blocking GitHub)
- **Daily Development Loop**: Pull ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Merge workflow
- **Safety Practices**: Backup branches, stable tags, when to backup
- **Rollback Procedures**: Undo commits, restore from backups, emergency recovery
- **Integration with Scripts**: How to use `premerge.sh` effectively
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Future Transition**: Steps to move to PR workflow after running `cleanup-history.sh`
- **Quick Reference Table**: Copy-paste commands for common tasks

### 2. Updated `docs/SCRIPTS.md`

Added a prominent **‚ö†Ô∏è Note About PR Mode** section after "What It Does" in the `premerge.sh` documentation:

- Explains that `MODE=pr` is currently blocked by large files
- Recommends using `MODE=local` for now
- Links to `LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed workflow
- Links to `cleanup-history.sh` for how to fix

### 3. Updated `README.md` (2 locations)

**In Utility Scripts section:**
- Added link to `LOCAL_WORKFLOW.md` with note "(current, until history cleanup)"
- Updated quick reference to show `MODE=local` as current workflow
- Reordered examples to emphasize local-first approach

**In Contributing section:**
- Updated step 5 to show two options:
  - **Option A (current):** Local merge with `MODE=local ./scripts/premerge.sh`
  - **Option B (future):** Push PR after running `cleanup-history.sh`
- Added link to Local Workflow Guide for details

## Quick Reference for Users

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my feature"

# 3. Verify changes
./scripts/premerge.sh

# 4. Merge locally
MODE=local ./scripts/premerge.sh

# 5. Tag stable point
git tag -a v1.3.0-local -m "Stable: My feature"
```

### Safety Commands

```bash
# Before risky changes
git branch backup/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Restore from tag
git reset --hard v1.2.0-local
```

### When to Move to PR Workflow

Run this when ready to enable remote pushes:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup-history.sh
git remote add origin <url>
git push --force --all
git push --force --tags
```

Then use:

```bash
MODE=pr ./scripts/premerge.sh
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

When you're ready to enable remote workflow:

1. **Review Local Work**: Ensure all commits are good and tagged
2. **Backup Everything**: `git branch backup/before-cleanup`
3. **Run Cleanup**: `./scripts/cleanup-history.sh`
4. **Force Push**: `git push --force --all` (one-time only)
5. **Test PR Mode**: `MODE=pr ./scripts/premerge.sh`
