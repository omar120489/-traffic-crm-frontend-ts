## üìã Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive test plan for the rollback workflow (`.github/workflows/rollback-release.yml`) to ensure reliable disaster recovery capability.

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

1. ‚úÖ Verify rollback workflow executes successfully
2. ‚úÖ Validate version verification logic
3. ‚úÖ Confirm build process for previous versions
4. ‚úÖ Test deployment to production
5. ‚úÖ Verify smoke tests and health checks
6. ‚úÖ Validate issue tracking and notifications
7. ‚úÖ Ensure proper error handling and rollback

---

## üîß Pre-Test Setup

### **Environment Preparation**

```bash
# 1. Ensure staging environment is available
# 2. Create test release tags
git tag v1.0.0-test
git tag v2.0.0-test
git tag v3.0.0-test
git push origin --tags

# 3. Verify workflow file exists
ls -la .github/workflows/rollback-release.yml

# 4. Verify required secrets are configured
# - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (optional)
# - Deployment credentials (if applicable)

# 5. Ensure test environment URLs are configured
# - Staging: https://staging.example.com
# - Production: https://example.com
```

### **Test Data**

## üö® Incident Response

### **If Rollback Fails in Production**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Assess impact and severity
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Activate incident response team

2. **Manual Rollback**:

   ```bash
   # If automated rollback fails, perform manual rollback
   git checkout v2.0.0-test
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm --filter ./apps/frontend run build
   pnpm --filter ./apps/core-api run build
   # Deploy manually using your deployment method
   ```

3. **Investigation**:
   - Review workflow logs
   - Identify failure point
   - Document root cause

4. **Post-Mortem**:
   - Document incident
   - Update rollback workflow if needed
   - Update test plan
   - Conduct team review

---
