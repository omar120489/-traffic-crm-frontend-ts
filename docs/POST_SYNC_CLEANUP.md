# Post-Sync Cleanup Guide

After successfully syncing your repository to GitHub and confirming everything works, you can safely clean up temporary backup files and branches.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Wait at least **7 days** after sync before performing cleanup to ensure everything is stable.

---

## 📅 Cleanup Timeline

### Immediate (Day 0 - After Sync)

✅ Verify sync successful  
✅ Test CI/CD pipelines  
✅ Verify all branches/tags pushed  
✅ Test PR workflow  

### Week 1 (Days 1-7)

✅ Monitor repository for issues  
✅ Verify team can clone and work  
✅ Ensure backups are accessible  
✅ Document any problems  

### Week 2+ (After 7+ Days)

✅ Safe to clean up backups  
✅ Remove temporary branches  
✅ Clean up local `.git.backup.*`

## 🧹 Cleanup Checklist

### Step 1: Verify Everything Works

Before cleaning up, confirm:

```bash
cd /Users/kguermene/Desktop/traffic-crm-frontend-ts_20251018_055516

# 1. Check remote is correct
git remote -v
# Should show: https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts.git

# 2. Fetch latest from GitHub
git fetch origin

# 3. Verify branches
git branch -r
# Should see all expected branches

# 4. Verify tags
git tag
# Should see all expected tags

# 5. Check repository size
du -sh .git
# Should be ~78 MB (not 986 MB)

# 6. Verify CI is passing
# Check: https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts/actions
```

### Step 2: Clean Up Local Backup Branches

```bash
# List backup branches
git branch | grep backup/before-sync

# Expected output:
# backup/before-sync-20251023-143502

# Delete backup branches (only after 7+ days!)
git branch -d backup/before-sync-20251023-143502

# If forced deletion needed (branch not merged):
git branch -D backup/before-sync-20251023-143502

# Verify deletion
git branch | grep backup/before-sync
# Should return nothing
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Local .git.backup Directories

```bash
# List backup directories
ls -d .git.backup.*

# Expected output:
# .git.backup.20251023

# Check size before deletion
du -sh .git.backup.*
# Will be ~900+ MB

# Delete backup directories (only after 7+ days!)
rm -rf .git.backup.20251023

# Verify deletion
ls -d .git.backup.* 2>/dev/null
# Should return nothing
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Temporary Test Branches

```bash
# List your branches
git branch -a

# Delete test branches created during setup
git branch -d test/branch-protection
git branch -d test/sync-verification
git push origin --delete test/branch-protection

# Clean up remote tracking branches that no longer exist
git remote prune origin
```

### Step 5: Clean Up Old Archive Files (Optional)

If you have any backup archives:

```bash
# Check for archives
ls -lh *.tar.gz *.zip

# Delete if found (only if you have confirmed backups elsewhere)
# rm -f backup_*.tar.gz
```

## 📊 Space Savings

After cleanup, you should see:

| Item | Before | After | Savings |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `.git/` directory | 986 MB | 78 MB | 908 MB |
| Backup branches | ~100 MB | 0 MB | ~100 MB |
| `.git.backup.*` | ~900 MB | 0 MB | ~900 MB |
| **Total** | **~2 GB** | **~78 MB** | **~1.9 GB** |

## 🔒 Safety Checks

### Before Deleting Backups

Run these commands to ensure you're safe:

```bash
# 1. Verify GitHub has everything
git ls-remote origin | wc -l
# Should show all refs (branches + tags)

# 2. Verify local and remote commits match
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main
# Should be identical

# 3. Check for uncommitted changes
git status
# Should be clean

# 4. Verify CI is passing on GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts/actions
# All checks should be green

# 5. Verify team can clone successfully
# Have a teammate run:
# git clone https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts.git
# cd -traffic-crm-frontend-ts
# pnpm install
# pnpm dev
```

### Emergency Rollback Plan

If you accidentally delete something important:

#### If you just deleted (< 5 minutes ago)

```bash
# Restore from macOS Trash if using Finder
# Or check terminal history for exact commands
```

#### If backups were deleted

```bash
# If .git.backup still exists in Trash:
# 1. Restore from Trash
# 2. Rename current .git
mv .git .git.corrupted
# 3. Restore backup
mv .git.backup.20251023 .git
# 4. Verify
git log -5
```

#### If all else fails

```bash
# Clone fresh from GitHub
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts.git traffic-crm-restored
cd traffic-crm-restored
# All your code is on GitHub!
```

## 🗓️ Maintenance Schedule

### One-Time (After Initial Sync)

- [x] Wait 7 days after sync ✅
- [ ] Verify GitHub sync successful
- [ ] Clean up local backup branches
- [ ] Clean up `.git.backup.*` directories
- [ ] Verify space savings

### Ongoing Maintenance

#### Weekly

- Review and delete stale feature branches
- Clean up merged PR branches
- Run `git gc` to optimize repository

#### Monthly

- Audit repository size: `du -sh .git`
- Clean up remote branches: `git remote prune origin`
- Review and archive old tags if needed

#### Quarterly

- Review repository health
- Audit large files: `git rev-list --objects --all | grep "$(git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/*.idx | sort -k 3 -n | tail -10 | awk '{print$1}')"`
- Consider running cleanup-history.sh again if size grows

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I accidentally deleted something important!"

**If it was a file:**

```bash
git reflog
# Find the commit before deletion
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

**If it was a branch:**

```bash
git reflog | grep branch-name
# Find the commit
git checkout -b branch-name <commit-hash>
```

**If it was the entire .git directory:**

```bash
# Restore from .git.backup if still available
# Otherwise, clone from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/omar120489/-traffic-crm-frontend-ts.git
```

### "Repository size didn't decrease"

```bash
# Run Git garbage collection
git gc --aggressive --prune=now

# Check again
du -sh .git
```

### "GitHub shows old/deleted branches"

```bash
# Prune remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin

# Verify
git branch -r
```
