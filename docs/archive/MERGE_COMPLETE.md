- **TypeScript**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy errors (expected, not blocking)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Large Files in History

GitHub push is currently blocked due to large files in the repository history:
- `.backups/repo_before_cleanup_20251023-053542.tar.gz` (431 MB)
- `berry-v3.9.0.fig` (170 MB)

These files were removed from tracking (`.gitignore` updated), but they persist in git history.

### Solution Options

**Option A: BFG Repo-Cleaner** (Recommended for shared repos)
```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg  # or download from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Clean large files from history
bfg --delete-files '*.tar.gz' --delete-files '*.fig' .

# Force push (coordinate with team!)
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push origin --force --all
```

**Option B: Continue Locally** (Current state)
The merge is complete locally. You can continue development and merge future branches locally until the history is cleaned up.

**Option C: Fresh Remote Branch**
If you need to push immediately, you could:
1. Create a new orphan branch from current `main`
2. Force push to a new branch name
3. Create PR from the new branch

## Current State

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch
# Should show: * main

# Verify merge
git log --oneline -5
# Should show the merge commit at the top

# View all changes
git show --stat HEAD
```

## Next Steps

### To Continue Locally
```bash
# Start new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-next-feature

# Work as normal
# ...

# Merge locally when done
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feature/your-next-feature
```

### To Test the Full Stack
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start services
pnpm db:up && pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:seed
pnpm --filter @apps/core-api dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
pnpm sdk:gen
pnpm --filter ./apps/frontend dev

# Browser: http://localhost:5173
```

## Documentation

All docs are in `/docs`:
- `MONOREPO_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` ‚Äî Monorepo structure
- `PHASE_2_PLAN.md` ‚Äî Migration roadmap
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` ‚Äî Architecture overview
- `guides/SDK_MIGRATION.md` ‚Äî SDK integration guide
- `guides/BRANDING_SETUP.md` ‚Äî Logo and PWA setup

## Summary

‚úÖ **The merge is complete and everything works locally!**

The only blocker for pushing to GitHub is the large files in history. Once those are cleaned up (using BFG or similar), you'll be able to push normally.

For now, you can continue development locally and merge branches as needed. üöÄ
