# Berry Material React Admin Template

## ðŸš€ Getting Started 
Follow these steps to set up the project:

2. Install packages

```

3. Run project

## ðŸ†š Difference Between Full Version and Seed

The <b>full-version</b> of the Berry Admin Template includes a complete, ready-to-use dashboard with all features, pages, components, and configurations pre-integratedâ€”ideal for production use or exploring the full capabilities of the template.

The <b>seed version</b> offers a minimal setup with only essential dependencies and folder structure, allowing developers to build their project from a clean slate. This version is best suited for those who prefer full control over customization and want to integrate components gradually.

## ðŸ§ª Mock/Fake Backend

We use a mock backend to provide necessary data and handle JWT authentication as well. This mock backend is shared across various apps for consistent data handling. You can check the network tab to trace API calls. You can find the mock backend server in the following GitHub repository:
